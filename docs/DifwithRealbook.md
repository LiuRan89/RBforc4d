# Dif with RealBook:

I didn't know about Realbook before, Riggedbook is the C4D version of my same name flipping book plugin for Blender.([Riggebook for blender](https://www.blendermarket.com/products/riggedbooks))

But I read the introduction about Realbook. The summary is as follows.


## Similar features:
Both plugins have many similar features.

1. Hardcover and softcover books, 
2. The ability to adjust the length, width, height, number of pages, curvature of pages, curvature of the side
3. Flexible custom page turning order.


## Differences:

### Rig methods are different:
Riggedbook's rig methods are different:

Realbook are made using mograph, while Riggedbook are made separately page by page using binding methods. 

So Compare with Realbooks:

#### Riggedbook's Advantages:
1. The Riggebook's cover and  pages have preset keyframes, which can be directly adjusted on the keyframe panel to adjust the page's turning order and turning speed, making it more intuitive.

2. The Riggebook hardcover model is a whole, while the front and side of the Realbook cover are separate, with a clear break at the seam.

4. Riggebook has the option of soft cover books, meaning that the cover of the book can also be bend, making it more suitable for creating books like magazines with soft cover covers.

10. Cheaper.

2. Realbooks is made using mograph, making it lighter to use.
3. Realbooks supports more versions of C4D.
