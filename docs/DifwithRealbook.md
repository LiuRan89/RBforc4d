# Dif with RealBook:

Compared with Realbooks, first of all, Riggedbook's rig methods are different.
Realbooks are made using mograph, while Riggedbooks are made separately page by page using binding methods.
Both plugins have many similar features, such as hardcover and softcover books, the ability to adjust the length, width, height, number of pages, curvature of pages, curvature of the side, and so on.

There are also some differences.

### Advantages:
1. The Riggebook's cover and  pages have preset keyframes, which can be directly adjusted on the keyframe panel to adjust the page's turning order and turning speed, making it more intuitive.
