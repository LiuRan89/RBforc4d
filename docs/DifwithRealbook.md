# Dif with RealBook:

Riggedbook is the C4D version of my same name flipping book plugin for Blender.([Riggebook for blender](https://www.blendermarket.com/products/riggedbooks))

I read the introduction about Realbook. The summary is as follows.


## Similar features:
Both plugins have many similar features.

1. Hardcover and softcover books.
2. The ability to adjust the length, width, height, number of pages, curvature of pages, curvature of the spine.
3. Flexible custom page turning order.


## Differences:

### Rig methods are different:

Realbook is made with mograph, while Riggedbook is made separately page by page using binding methods. 

So Compare with Realbooks:

### Riggedbook's Advantages:

1. The Riggebook hardcover model is a whole, while the front and side of the Realbook cover are separate, with a clear break at the seam.

3. Realbooks supports more versions of C4D.
